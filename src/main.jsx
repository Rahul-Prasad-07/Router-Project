// This first route is what we often call the "root route" since the rest of our routes will render inside of it. 
// It will serve as the root layout of the UI, we'll have nested layouts as we get farther along.
// However, it's not inside of our root layout ðŸ˜  --> Nested Routes : We want the contact component to render inside of the <Root> layout.
// We do it by making the contact route a child of the root route. -->You'll now see the root layout again but a blank page on the right. We need to tell the root route where we want it to render its child routes. We do that with <Outlet>.
// Find the <div id="detail"> and put an outlet inside
// ðŸ‘‰ Render an <Outlet>
